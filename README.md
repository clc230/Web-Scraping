# Web-Scraping

Scripts I've written in Python for web scraping tasks/projects. 

Included:
Script written to scrape data from Food Fortification Initiative, to assist a startup non-profit with their research efforts

Script written to scrape job postings from Indeed, to assist former employer with research on data analytics jobs and skills needed
